# Plays Frontend Practice Exercise

## Getting started:
 - You'll need to have `nodejs` installed (use the LTS version): https://nodejs.org/en/
 - Open up a terminal in this directory and run `npm install`
 - Once that finishes, run `npm start` and edit some files in the `/src/` directory!
 - The project should be running at http://localhost:8080/

## Building something:
The goal of this exercise is to create a basic video player that loads the video data and comments using AJAX. The main steps are:
 - `fetch` the video data json file from `/VideoData.json`
 - Display the video, video metadata and comments as per the mockups in `/mocks/`
 - Make the avatar images round, and highlight the names with the color used in the `--brand-color` css variable in `src/css/style.css`
 - Use default HTML5 video controls for the video, not the controls in the mockup (we may work on custom controls later in the process)
 - We're looking for simplicity, well structured code and the quality of the parts that you finish, not necessarily a 100% perfect rendering (you'd probably also need assets that we haven't included to do that)

## You've reached the end!
When you're done, you can run `npm run bundle` in your console, and it will create a .zip file for you to send back to us. 

We always appreciate a short note describing what you've done, how long it took, and anything that was confusing or that you struggled with.
